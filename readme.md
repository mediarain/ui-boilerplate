We are just getting started here, 
this utilizes Less CSS and gulp to compile the CSS and JavaScript/jQuery

## Getting Started
- In your CLI of choice (Terminal, iTerm, etc) run `npm install`
- run `gulp`

Thats it!

Your Less files will automatically compile into a main.css file within a styles folder (gulp does all of this) and you are up and running
Fully responsive
We offer 2 options: desktop first and mobile first responsive styling which is handled in /less/main.less
