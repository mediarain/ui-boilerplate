## Just The Beginning

We are just getting started here, 
This utilizes Less CSS and Gulp to compile the CSS and JavaScript/jQuery

## Getting Started
- In your CLI of choice (Terminal, iTerm, etc) run `npm install`
- run `gulp`
- thats it! (so far)

## The Rundown

Your Less files will automatically compile into a main.css file within a styles folder (gulp does all of this) and you are up and running.
This is build for fully responsive site(s)
It offer 2 options: desktop first and mobile first responsive styling which is handled in /less/main.less by importing the different Less files.

## Coming Soon
Well.. a lot.

- It will eventually be set up so that Gulp will watch and compile all .js files.
- Hopefully, we can build this in a way that can easily be dropped into most if not any projects and start up seemlessly.
